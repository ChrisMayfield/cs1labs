    Lab09: Writing and calling methods
</strong></font>
</div>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Last time we began to look at writing programs with multiple methods.
Today we will implement method stubs and learn about separate compilation.
You will also use command line arguments for the first time in a program.</p>

<br><i>Here's a song your methods will be singing...maybe. :)</i></p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Create a class without a main method, but containing some other methods.</p></li>
    <li><p>Stub out the class so that methods can be written and tested incrementally.</p></li>
    <li><p>Run a Java program from the Terminal and pass command line arguments.</p></li>
    <li><p>Become more familiar with the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html">Math class</a> in the Java Standard Library.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Terms</h3>
<dl>
<dt>void method</dt>
<dd>A method that does not return anything. Its return type is <code>void</code>.</dd>
<dt>value method</dt>
<dd>A method that returns some value, usually based on parameters.</dd>
<dt>return type</dt>
<dd>The data type the method returns; it comes after <code>public static</code>.</dd>
<dt>return value</dt>
<dd>The value that the method returns via the <code>return</code> statement.</dd>
<dt>method stub</dt>
<dd>An empty or incomplete method that returns 0, "", false, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>At the end of class today, or by 11:00 PM if you would like more time, submit CirclePlay.java via Canvas. As always, you are encouraged to work with another student to complete the lab.</p>

Part 1: Creating Stubs</strong></font></p>

<p>We are going to create a small class to carry out some geometry operations.
It will include a couple of utility methods to make input and printing easier, as well as the calculation of the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere.
(Normally, you would design one class to do the geometry and another one to deal with the utility methods, but for today's lab we are putting them together in one class.)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download and open the <a href="CircleDriver.java">CircleDriver.java</a> program. Do not be concerned with what it contains just yet.</li>
  <li>Create a new source file, <kbd>CirclePlay.java</kbd>.
  Create the class documentation including your name and today's date.</li>
  <li>Define each of the following methods:
    <blockquote>
      <table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
        <tr>
          <td>1. <kbd>printGreeting</kbd> will simply print some lines to greet the user upon running the application.
          Create a method stub by typing the following header and braces for the method block.
          <em>No code needs to be contained in the block at this time.</em>
            <blockquote>
              <p><code>public static void printGreeting()</code>. This header says that the method is public, returns nothing (<code>void</code>), is named printGreeting, and accepts no parameters.</p></blockquote>
              <p>Create method documentation. In this case you only need to describe what this method will do.</p>
            </p>
          </p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2. <kbd>enterRadius</kbd> - create a method header that looks like this:
            <blockquote>
            <p><code>public static double enterRadius()</code>. This header says the method is <code>public</code>, returns a value of <code>double</code> type, is named <code>enterRadius</code>, and accepts no parameters.</p>
            <p>Add method documentation for this method as follows: (note the use of the <code>@return</code> label)</p>
          </blockquote>
<pre>
/**
 * Displays a prompt to the user, then reads in a double value
 * that the user has entered.
 *
 * @return a double value representing a radius
 */
</pre>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Create the method block, and add in a single return statement, <code>return -999;</code>
        This is a "stubbed" return statement that returns a value of the correct type, but is not the value we will eventually need.</p></blockquote>
      </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><p>3. <kbd>calculateArea</kbd> - This method will calculate the area of a circle with a given radius.</p>
            <p>Create a method header that is <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, returns a <code>double</code> value, is named <code>calculateArea</code> and has a single parameter, a <code>double</code> value representing a radius. </p>
            <p>Create the method block with a return statement to return the value -888. (These are meaningless values, but if we call the method and its not done, we'll know that by the return value.) </p>
            <p>Add your documentation including an <code>@param</code> tag. (See <a href="../wk-02/Lab03-Checkstyle.html">Lab03</a> to review the <code>@param</code> tag.)</p></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><p>4. <kbd>calculateVolume</kbd> - This method will calculate the volume of a sphere with a given radius.</p>
          <p>Create a method header, method block, return statement, and documentation as for <kbd>calculateArea</kbd>. </p></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
  </li>
  <li>Save and compile your work at this point, <em>before implementing any of the methods</em>. You should not have any compiler errors.
  If you do, check to make sure that each method in CirclePlay is created exactly as described above.</li>
  <li>Run CircleDriver from DrJava or using the command line. What output do you see? Does it make any sense?</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we will begin to fill in our stubbed methods.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="+1" color="blue"><strong>
Part 2: Creating a Void Method With No Parameters</strong></font></p>

<p>Begin with <code>printGreeting</code>, which should print the following.
(Note that &lt;blank line&gt; just means that you should print a newline there.)</p>
<pre>Welcome to the Circle Calculator
&lt;blank line&gt;
This application will calculate the area of a circle and/or volume of a sphere.
&lt;blank line&gt;
</pre>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Create the code to print these four lines. Compile your code in DrJava, but run it from the command line.</li>
  <li>You are currently testing the 1st method, so pass the argument 1 to the main method as follows:</li>
<p><code>java CircleDriver 1</code></p>
  <li>Does your greeting print correctly? Make any corrections that you need before moving on.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Explanation</em>: The CircleDriver is designed to let you test each of your methods separately.
In this case, you have built a single method, so you are testing just that method.
The method stubs enable you to compile the entire program, but then just fill in the parts that you are ready to complete and test.
By testing individual methods, you can focus on getting that method written correctly before moving on to the next one.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>

<p align="center"><font size="+1" color="blue"><strong>
Part 3: Creating a Value Returning Method With No Parameters</strong></font></p>

<p>Next you'll fill in the <code>enterRadius</code> method.
This method displays a standard prompt, <code>"Enter the radius: "</code> and then reads in the radius from the keyboard.
You will need to create a Scanner object as part of this method.</p>
<ol start="9">
  <li>You need to declare at least two variables: a Scanner and a double. The double will hold the radius that the user enters.</li>
  <li>Instantiate the Scanner (using the <code>new</code> keyword).</li>
  <li>Output the prompt "Enter the radius: ". The cursor should remain on the same line, one space to the right of the colon.</li>
  <li>Read the value that the user enters.</li>
  <li>Change the <code>return</code> statement to return the value that the user enters.</li>
  <li>Test your program on the command line. This time enter the number 2 as the command line argument. What happens?</li>
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;</p><hr>

<p align="center"><font size="+1" color="blue"><strong>
Part 4: Creating Value-Returning Methods With Parameters</strong></font></p>

<p>Finally, you will fill in each of the calculation methods.
You are going to calculate the area of a circle and the volume of a sphere.
The area of a circle is defined as A&nbsp;=&nbsp;&pi;&nbsp;r&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>.
The volume of a sphere is V&nbsp;=&nbsp;4/3&nbsp;&pi;&nbsp;r&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>.
Use these formulas to come up with a few test cases for each method.</p>
<ol start="15">
  <li>Write down your examples on a piece of paper, so you can be sure your code works as expected. </li>
  <li>Begin with the <code>calculateArea</code> method.
  You may find that the Math class (provided in the java.lang package) is helpful for this step.
  First, there is a constant defined in that class called PI.
  Since the constant is in another class, we must use the qualified name <code>Math.PI</code> to access it.</li>
  <li>Define the variables that you will need.</li>
  <li>Create the calculation using Math.PI for &pi;.</li>
  <li>Instead of the stub value in your <code>return</code> statement, return the area that you calculate.</li>
  <li>Test your work passing the number 3 in for the command line argument.</li>
  <li>Check your area values against the ones that you calculated by hand. Work with your method until it runs correctly.</li>
  <li>Create the <code>calculateVolume</code> method and test as before using command line argument 4 to test your volume method.</li>
  <li>Finally, test the entire application running the application with no arguments. It should run each method in turn.</li>
</ol>

Part 5: Optional Awesomeness and Bragging Rights</strong></font></p>

<p>If you find you're writing the same code over and over again, it's a good idea to put that code into a method. We're going to have a little competition to illustrate this point. Think of a typical song from popular culture: it often repeats the same phrases over and over again. It's as if the song writers created a bunch of methods and then called them...maybe? (ha ha)</p>

<p>Using <a href="CallMeMaybe.java">CallMeMaybe.java</a> as a starting point, see if you can rewrite the program using as few <code>System.out.println</code> statements as possible by breaking down the song into multiple methods. You don't need to write javadoc comments for these methods. <font color="red">You may NOT change or combine any of the existing println statements</font>, but you may delete as many as you like. In the end your program's output must match <a href="CallMeMaybe.txt">CallMeMaybe.txt</a> exactly (use <code>diff</code> or <code>meld</code> to compare your results).</p>

<p>If you're up for this challenge (and possibly EXTRA CREDIT) then submit your completed CallMeMaybe.java file along with your CirclePlay.java file. Be sure to replace the <code>??</code>'s in the documentation comment with your final results.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>We've been studying exact solutions to well-defined problems all semester long. Ill-defined problems are those that do not have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solution (Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving">problem solving</a>). Sometimes an educated guess is the best algorithm. Today you will experiment writing programs that navigate a Finch robot through a maze.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Review loops, decisions, and method calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Practice iterative development and testing.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>You may use the following code as a staring point:&nbsp;
    <a href="Maze.java"><img src="../icons/disk.png"> Maze.java</a></p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Throughout the lab, we will have a friendly competition. The winning robot must successfully navigate a small maze of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber#Dimensional_lumber">2x4's</a> arranged on the floor.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Be sure to set the LED to a different color for each state of your program. This technique makes it a lot easier to debug your code.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Don't forget to program an ending sequence. For example, you may cover the light sensors by hand to instruct the Finch to terminate its control loop.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Your robot must be completely autonomous. The following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>Once you start your program, you must let it run to completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>You may NOT control your Finch interactively from the terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>You may NOT pick up and change the direction of your Finch.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>You may interact with the Finch using any of its sensors.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>Create a plain text file named <code>reflection.txt</code> and answer the
following questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>
    <p>What heuristics did you use in your solution? Why did you decide to use them instead of others?</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Which strategies performed the best during the competition? What did you learn by participating?</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Over the course of the semester, what gave you the most difficulty and how did you overcome it?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Submit your reflection via Canvas by the end of the day. <b><font color="red">Don't forget to write your name at the top of the file.</font></b></p>

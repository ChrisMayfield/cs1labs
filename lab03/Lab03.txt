CS 149 - Lab03 Worksheet

Name:


1. What computer and operating system did you use to complete this lab?



2. Briefly summarize 8--10 commands that you learned from the tutorial.
Each command should be a single word followed by a short description.
Don't just list every example from the lab; "ls", "ls -a", and "ls -l"
only count as one command (ls). Instead, write your answers like this:

The "ls" command lists directory contents. The -a option shows all files, and
the -l option shows a long listing with permissions, sizes, and dates.



3. What is the meaning of the symbols ~, ., .., and * on the command line?



4. What is the difference between the >, >>, and | command-line operators?

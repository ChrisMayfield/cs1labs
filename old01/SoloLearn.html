<h3>Part 1: Online Tutorial</h3>

<p>SoloLearn is a relatively new (and free!) platform for learning how to program.
They offer fun and interactive <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/">courses</a> in a variety of languages, including Java.</p>

<p>To get started, visit <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">sololearn.com</a> and either download the app or click learn on the web.
Sign up for an account (using Facebook, Google, or other email), start the Java Tutorial, and complete the "Basic Concepts" module.</p>

<p>Part of this module walks you through how to install Java and Eclipse on your own computer.
These steps are optional, but highly recommended so that you can work from home (in addition to the Linux lab).
Mac users can just ignore the Windows instructions for setting up the PATH (under "Installing the JDK").</p>

<p>We will be using DrJava instead of Eclipse for the first ten weeks of CS 149.
Here are detailed instructions for <a href="../help/drjava.html">installing DrJava</a>.
If you run into trouble getting things installed, just complete the rest of the module. We'll sort things out later this week.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Canvas Submission</h3>

<p>Download and open the <a href="Lab01.txt">Lab01.txt</a> worksheet and answer the questions.
Make sure you save this file as plain text; if you use Word, you'll need to "Save as" and change the type to "Plain Text".
And please do NOT change the name of the file; Canvas automatically appends your first and last name to the filename when I download the submissions for grading.</p>

<p>Upload your completed worksheet to the Lab01 assignment on Canvas before 11:00 PM. After submitting, take a few minutes to complete your Canvas account setup:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Canvas, click the "Account" icon on the upper left, then click "Settings".</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven't done so already, please set up a profile picture of your choice.</p></li>
<li><p>If you'd like to receive text messages from Canvas, click "+ Contact Method" on the right.</p></li>
<li><p>Click "Notifications" on the left sidebar and verify what emails/texts you want to receive.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(These last steps are required for the lab. You'll lose points if your profile picture is still a ghost.)</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The workstations in ISAT/CS 143 and ISAT/CS 250 run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, and the iMacs in ISAT/CS 248 run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">macOS</a>.
Both operating systems are based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a> and come with a powerful suite of general purpose <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU">computing tools</a>.
Many of these tools are only available via the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line interface</a> (also known as the "Terminal").
You will learn some of these commands in this course and others throughout your career.
Today we will focus on the basic survival skills for navigating the command line and a Unix-based file system.</p>

<h3>Part 1: Getting Started</h3>

<p>There are multiple options for completing this lab:
(1) use a Linux machine in the CS department,
(2) connect to the <code>student</code> server using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/wUW2pnYqWRw">SSH or PuTTY</a>,
or (3) get things working on your own computer.
We recommend the last option, since it will enable you to be more productive throughout the course.
But don't spend too long "getting started" if you run into problems; the video and Part 2 will already take about an hour to complete.</p>

<ul>
<li>
    <p>If you have a Mac computer, everything you need is already built-in.
    Simply find the "Terminal" app (press Command-Space to search for it).
    You may want to add this app to your Dock permanently, since you'll be using it a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>If you have a Windows computer, you may want to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cygwin.com/install.html">install Cygwin</a>.
    This collection of tools provides a UNIX-like environment on Windows and creates a Terminal shortcut on your Desktop.
    If you're not sure how to run the installer, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=install+cygwin">search YouTube</a> for instructions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have a Terminal running, watch the video below and follow along on your own computer by typing the same commands.
Pay attention to how the video demonstrates tab-completion.
The up/down arrows and the tab key are your best friends when working on the command line!</p>

<h3>Part 2: Online Tutorial</h3>

<p>Work through the <em>first four</em> parts of <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS139_S16/activities/unix_tutorial/">UNIX Tutorial for Beginners</a></strong>. The first part is more or less a review of the video. The fifth part is optional.</p>

<p>Download and open the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="Lab02.txt">Lab02.txt</a> worksheet and answer the questions.
Make sure you save this file as plain text; if you use Word, you'll need to "Save as" and change the type to "Plain Text".
And please do NOT change the name of the file; Canvas automatically appends your first and last name to the filename when I download the submissions for grading.</p>

<p>Upload your completed worksheet to the Lab02 assignment on Canvas.
If you have questions, feel free to start a discussion on Piazza.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>This final Scratch lab will introduce more advanced programming constructs
that allow you to manipulate numbers and text. We will also explore several
ideas and techniques for your self-directed programming assignment due later
this week.</p>

Part 1: Basic Conversion
</strong></font></p>

<p><em>As we transition to Java later this week, several of the example programs
we will do involve converting values of one format into another. The purpose of
this exercise is to write a small "conversion" program in Scratch.</em></p>

<p>
<b>Step 1.</b>
Begin with an empty Scratch project and click on the "Sensing" palette. Drag an
"ask" block onto the scripts area. Click on the script and answer the question
that the cat asks you.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where does the answer get stored? What happens when you click it?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>What happens when you click the check box next to the answer?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Step 2.</b>
Now click the "Looks" palette and snap a "say" block under the "ask" block.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How can you get the sprite to say the answer from Step 1?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>How can you make the message disappear after four seconds?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Step 3.</b>
Find the "join" block on the "Operators" palette.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How can you get the sprite to say "Hello, _____" using your answer?
    (There should be a space between the comma and the answer value.)</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>How can you output "I think _____ is cool!" using your answer?
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<p><em>Have you discovered the "Tips" menu? You may want to refer to the
"How To" and "Blocks" reference pages linked from that sidebar.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<b>Step 4.</b>
Variables allow you to save values for use in blocks with rounded or rectangular
holes (which correspond to numbers and text, respectively).
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How do you ask the user for their first and last name separately?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>How can you display them back to the user in reverse order?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Step 5.</b>
Write a script that asks the user for a number of inches, converts that value
into centimeters (1 in = 2.54 cm), and displays the result.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How do you perform multiplication in Scratch?</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Raise your hand when finished and demonstrate your script to the instructor.</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

Part 2: Squares &amp; Circles
</strong></font></p>

<p>
<b>Step 6.</b>
You have been hired to design a new marketing campaign for JMU sports. The
coaches would like something with gold squares and purple circles. Refer to
the <a href="Shapes.pdf"><img src="../icons/pdf.png"> Shapes handout</a>
for ideas. And try to incorporate the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Dog">Duke Dog</a>
into your project somehow.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spend at least 15 minutes designing a project you can show to the class.</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Raise your hand when finished and demonstrate your work to the instructor.</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Write a short description of your project below (2-3 complete sentences).</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

Part 3: Automatic Drawing
</strong></font></p>

<p>
<b>Step 7.</b>
In Scratch, each sprite has a "pen" it can draw with as it moves around the
stage (see the "Pen" palette). This idea is known as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">turtle graphics</a> and
enables you to program your own drawings. For a completely random example, see
the <a href="Drawing.pdf"><img src="../icons/pdf.png"> Drawing handout</a>.
Figure out how to draw something simple, like a geometric shape or repeating pattern.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Spend at least 15 minutes designing a project you can show to the class.</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Raise your hand when finished and demonstrate your work to the instructor.</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <li>Write a short description of your project below (2-3 complete sentences).</li>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</ul>

<p><em>
Again, you should check out the "Tips" menu -- particularly the one about the
pen blocks.

    Lab04: Concatenation and types
</strong></font>
</div>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Java is a strongly typed language. In some cases, automatic conversion may
occur to make both operands the same type before the operation is carried
out. In other cases, automatic conversion cannot be done. This lab explores
some of these features while also exploring the Scanner class.</p>

<p><em>Collaboration:</em> You are encouraged to work with another student to complete this lab. Each of you should submit your own copy of the programs. It's okay if your files are similar or identical, as long as both of your names are present at the top.</p>

<p><em>Submission:</em> At the end of class today, or by 11:00 PM if you would like more time, submit both Concat.java and Types.java via Canvas.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<h3>Part 1: Two meanings of +</h3>

<p>Download: <a href="Concat.java"><img src="../icons/disk.png"> Concat.java</a> (right-click, Save link as..., navigate to <tt>CS149/Lab04</tt>)</p>

<p>In Java, the symbol <span class="code">+</span> can be used to add numbers
or to concatenate strings. This lab illustrates both uses.</p>

<p>When using a String <em>literal</em> (i.e., a sequence of characters enclosed
in double quote marks) in Java, the complete String must fit on one line. The
following is NOT legal; it would result in a compile-time error.</p>
<pre>
System.out.println("It is NOT okay to go to the next line
        in a LONG string!!!");
</pre>

<p>The solution is to break the long String up into two shorter strings that
are joined using the concatenation operator (which is the <kbd>+</kbd> symbol). So the following would be legal.</p>
<pre>
System.out.println("It is OKAY to break a long string into "
        + "parts and join them with a '+' symbol.");
</pre>

<p>Note how the continued line is indented two blocks to indicate it is a
continuation line. Also note that the operator is placed at the beginning of
the continuation line instead of at the end of the first line, to improve
readability.</p>

<p>So when working with strings, the <kbd>+</kbd> symbol means
to concatenate the Strings (join them). BUT when working with numbers, the
<kbd>+</kbd> means what it has always meant: to add!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Concat.java file. <span class="red">Do not compile or run
  the program yet.</span><br></li>

  <li>Unlike primitive data types (like int and double), Strings are Java classes
  just like the Concat program itself is a class. As such, String has methods or
  actions that can be done.<br></li>

  <li>This program uses the <kbd>length</kbd> method of the
  String class. <kbd>length</kbd> is a method that returns a
  value which, in this example, is the number of characters in <span class=
  "name">sample</span>. Or another way to read this is "sample's length".</li>

  <li>"Hand trace" the program. That is, act as if you were a computer and
  execute each statement in the program like a computer would.</li>

  <li>Write the output your hand tracing produces on paper. <span class=
  "red">Raise your hand and show the instructor your paper before
  proceeding.</span></li>

  <li>Compile and run the actual java program. Compare your "expected result"
  with the "actual result".</li>

  <li>For each line where the "expected result" differed from the "actual
  result", do you understand why your prediction was wrong? If you cannot
  figure it out so you know for sure, ASK!</li>
</ol>

<p>Correct the second output statement so blanks are printed around the 55.
Recompile and run.</p>

<p>Before turning in this assignment, <span class="red">summarize what you have
learned in the Javadoc comment for main.</span> Be sure to fill in your name and
today's date in the class's Javadoc comment.</p>

<h3>Part 2: Input in Java</h3>

<p>Download: <a href="Types.java"><img src="../icons/disk.png"> Types.java</a> (right-click, Save link as..., navigate to <tt>CS149/Lab04</tt>)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Types.java file.</li>

  <li>Read through the program, noticing the following new features:

    <ol>
      <li><kbd>Scanner</kbd> - The <kbd>Scanner</kbd> class provides a mechanism for reading in values
      from the keyboard (among other things).</li>

      <li>The very first line of the source file is an <kbd>import</kbd> statement. This import makes the Scanner class
      available to this program.<br></li>

      <li>Before we can use the <kbd>Scanner</kbd>, we must make
      an instance of it. We call an instance of a class an object. So we need
      to create a <kbd>Scanner</kbd> object.<br></li>

      <li>So, we first declare a <kbd>Scanner</kbd> variable
      named <kbd>input</kbd>. Then in the initializations, we
      instantiate or make a new <kbd>Scanner</kbd> object. The
      value in the parentheses is <kbd>System.in</kbd> which
      refers to standard system input or the keyboard.</li>

      <li>Whenever we expect the user of a program to enter something at the
      command line, we have to prompt them. The line <kbd>System.out.print("Enter a number: ");</kbd> is performing the
      prompt. When you run this program, the line will display, then the
      program will stop executing until the user enters a value on the command
      line. The line <kbd>num1 = input.nextInt();</kbd> is the
      place where the input Scanner is reading what the user has typed in
      and assigning it to the variable <kbd>num1</kbd>.</li>

      <li>We then "echo" the value of <kbd>num1</kbd> in the
      following line.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Compile the program and execute it. Use any integer value for
  <kbd>num1.</kbd> (What happens if you don't type in an integer?)</li>

  <li>Now, duplicate the four lines at the end of the program and alter them to
  read a value into <kbd>val1</kbd>. You will need to use the
  <kbd>nextDouble()</kbd> method instead of <kbd>nextInt().</kbd> There should be a blank line between this new block
  of code and the previous one.</li>

  <li>Compile and execute the program with your changes.</li>

  <li>Finally, duplicate the last four lines again and alter them to read a
  value into <kbd>text</kbd>. You will need to use the
  <kbd>nextLine()</kbd> method instead of <kbd>nextDouble()</kbd>. Make sure you are also updating the comments!<br>
  <br>
  <span style="color: red;">NOTE:</span> When reading in numbers via nextInt or
  nextDouble, Scanner does not read the newline character that you typed (by
  pressing Enter). If you want to read the next line of text, you may need to
  call nextLine twice! The first call reads the newline after the number, and
  the second call reads the next line of text.</li>
</ol><span class="red">Raise your hand and show the instructor your working
program before proceeding.</span>

<h3>Part 3: Data types and compatibility</h3>

The last part of the lab will have
you practice with different data types. The three shown in this lab are the
ones you will most commonly use. <span class="gre">Questions in green are
thought questions only and do not need to be turned in.</span><br>

<ol>
  <li>Add a statement to the end of the program to assign the value found in
  <kbd>text</kbd> to the variable <kbd>val1</kbd>.
  <span class="gre">What happens when you try to compile it?</span></li>

  <li>Comment out that line and add a new line that assigns the value of
  <kbd>val1</kbd> to <kbd>num1</kbd>. <span class=
  "gre">What happens when you try to compile it?</span></li>

  <li>Comment out that line and add a new line that assigns the value of
  <kbd>val1</kbd> to <kbd>val2</kbd>. <span class=
  "gre">What happens when you try to compile it? Will it
  execute?</span><br></li>

  <li>Add a print statement to display the contents of <kbd>val1</kbd> and <kbd>val2</kbd> after the
  assignment.<br></li>

  <li>Add a statement to the end of the program to assign the value found in
  <kbd>num1</kbd> to <kbd>val2</kbd>. <span class=
  "gre">What happens when you try to compile it? Will it execute?</span></li>

  <li>Add a print statement to display the contents of <kbd>num1</kbd> and <kbd>val2</kbd> after the
  assignment.<br></li>

  <li>What can you say about compatibility among Java data types? In other
  words, when can you assign values of different data types to one another?
  <span class="red">Summarize your answer in the Javadoc comment for main.
  </span></li>
